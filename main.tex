% \previousdegrees{}
     % The abbreviated form of your previous degree(s).
     % E.g., \previousdegrees{B.S., MBA}.
     %
     % The default value is `B.S., M.S.'

\graduationmonth{May}      
     % Graduation month, either May, August, or December, in the form
     % as `\graduationmonth{May}'. Do not abbreviate.
     %
     % The default value (either May, August, or December) is guessed
     % according to the time of running LaTeX.

\graduationyear{2022}   
     % Graduation year, in the form as `\graduationyear{2001}'.
     % Use a 4 digit (not a 2 digit) number.
     %
     % The default value is guessed according to the time of 
     % running LaTeX.

% Commands for master's theses and reports.			     %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% If the degree you're seeking is NOT Doctor of Philosophy, uncomment
% (remove the % in front of) the following two command lines (the ones
% that have the \ as their second character).
%
\degree{Master of Science in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics}
\degreeabbr{M.S.}

% Uncomment the line below that corresponds to the type of master's
% document you are writing.

% \masterthesis

% Some optional commands to change the document's defaults.	     %

%\singlespacing
%\oneandonehalfspacing

%\singlespacequote
\oneandonehalfspacequote

\topmargin 0.125in	% Adjust this value if the PostScript file output
			% of your dissertation has incorrect top and 
			% bottom margins. Print a copy of at least one
			% full page of your dissertation (not the first
			% page of a chapter) and measure the top and
			% bottom margins with a ruler. You must have
			% a top margin of 1.5" and a bottom margin of
			% at least 1.25". The page numbers must be at
			% least 1.00" from the bottom of the page.
			% If the margins are not correct, adjust this
			% value accordingly and re-compile and print again.
			%
			% The default value is 0.125"

		% If you want to adjust other margins, they are in the
		% utdiss2-nn.sty file near the top. If you are using
		% the shell script Makediss on a Unix/Linux system, make
		% your changes in the utdiss2-nn.sty file instead of
		% utdiss2.sty because Makediss will overwrite any changes
		% made to utdiss2.sty.

% Some optional commands to be tested.				     %

% If there are 10 or more sections, 10 or more subsections for a section,
